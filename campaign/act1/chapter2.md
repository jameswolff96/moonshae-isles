## Chapter 2: Passage to the Isles

### Securing Passage

> **Read Aloud:**
> The salty breeze carries the cries of gulls and the rhythmic creak of wooden hulls. The docks are alive with activity—sailors hoisting crates, merchants shouting deals, and the constant hum of the sea. Among the many vessels moored here, each tells its own story. A sturdy green-painted ship named *The Emerald Gale* bobs steadily, its proud banner fluttering in the wind. Nearby, a heavily-laden merchant ship looms large, its crew working with practiced efficiency under the sharp gaze of its first mate, his gaze flicks toward you, and for a moment, he seems to weigh your worth before returning to his duties. At the far edge of the docks, a smaller schooner rests in shadow, its aged wood and faint glowing runes hinting at secrets best left unspoken. The choices before you seem as varied as the sea itself.

#### Option 1: Charter a Ship

- **The Emerald Gale**: Captained by the experienced and dependable **Daenor "Seafoam" Lothar**, this sturdy vessel is well-suited to the open seas and the fey-touched storms that surround the Isles.
- **Challenges:** Negotiating a fair price (Charisma [Persuasion] DC 13), dealing with rival captains trying to outbid them (Charisma [Deception] DC 15), or handling dockside disputes (Strength [Athletics] DC 12).

#### Option 2: Passage on a Merchant Ship

- **The Salted Gull**: A merchant vessel under the command of **First Mate Alric Sands**, who demands the party guard the cargo during the journey.
- **Challenges:** Convincing the merchant guild to allow them aboard (Charisma [Persuasion] DC 14), dealing with potential saboteurs (Wisdom [Insight] DC 13) or theft onboard (Dexterity [Sleight of Hand] DC 15 to catch a thief).

#### Option 3: Acquire Their Own Ship

> **Read Aloud:**
> Near the edge of the dockyard, past rows of bustling ships, lies a smaller schooner docked in shadow. Its hull is worn but seaworthy, and faint, glowing runes are etched along the wood. These runes match those found in Eryndor's note, sparking a sense of foreboding and intrigue. Nearby, a wiry human woman leans against a crate, her gaze darting nervously between the ship and the bustling crowd, as though she’s trying to avoid drawing attention.

- **The Wailing Mariner:**

  - **Description:** A small schooner with an eerie, aged appearance. Its dark wood hull is covered in faint, glowing runes, and its sails appear intact but unnaturally tattered.
  - **Price:** Initially asking for half price the shipwright, Reeda Wainwright, is so desperate to rid herself of the vessel she offers it to the player for free. She claims it has brought her nothing but bad luck and insists that as its new owners the players "accept all responsibility" for anything that happens to them.
  - **History:** The ship is cursed, its previous owners having vanished or died under mysterious circumstances.

- **Cursed Ship Mechanics:**

  - **Mysterious Events:** At sea, the ship begins to creak and groan as if alive. Strange whispers echo below deck, and crew members (including the party) may experience nightmares.
  - **Skill Challenges:** The curse occasionally manifests as sabotaged rigging (Dexterity [Acrobatics] DC 13), sudden malfunctions (Intelligence [Investigation] DC 15), or eerie illusions (Wisdom [Perception] DC 14). Players must succeed on Wisdom (Insight), Intelligence (Investigation), or Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks to resolve these issues.
  - **Fey Connection:** The curse ties the ship to the Feywild, and the party may encounter fey creatures or be pulled into the Feywild unexpectedly during storms or certain magical events.

- **Lifting the Curse:** To free the ship from its curse, the party must uncover its history and perform a ritual at a sacred site within the Moonshae Isles.

### Dockside NPCs

#### **Daenor "Seafoam" Lothar**

- **Role:** Captain of The Emerald Gale.
- **Personality:** Gruff but reliable, with a love for storytelling about the sea.
- **Hooks:** Daenor is willing to negotiate his price but insists on the party proving themselves trustworthy, possibly through a small task like delivering a parcel to another captain.

#### **Alric Sands**

- **Role:** First Mate of The Salted Gull.
- **Personality:** Stern and pragmatic, focused on protecting his cargo.
- **Hooks:** Alric requires the party to take an oath of service during the voyage. He will be suspicious if the players hesitate or inquire too much about the cargo.

#### **Reeda Wainwright**

- **Role:** Local shipwright and seller of The Wailing Mariner.
- **Personality:** Nervous and evasive, constantly looking over her shoulder.
- **Hooks:** Reeda will emphasize the ship’s low price but avoid answering questions about its history. Players with a Wisdom (Insight, DC 12) check can detect her unease, and with a Charisma (Intimidation, DC 14) or Charisma (Persuasion, DC 15) check, she may reveal details about the ship’s curse if pressed.

#### **Thalen "Lucky" Voss**

- **Role:** A charismatic dockworker who offers to join the party as crew.
- **Personality:** Charming and optimistic, though his "luck" often gets others into trouble.
- **Hooks:** Thalen’s luck is actually tied to a minor fey blessing, which occasionally backfires. His presence could lead to both fortuitous and disastrous events during the voyage.

### Setting Sail

> **Read Aloud:**
> The Sword Sea stretches before you, its waves shimmering faintly as if touched by magic. Sailors whisper tales of sudden storms and ghostly lights that dance on the horizon. The air is thick with salt and mystery, and the creak of the ship’s hull reminds you that this journey will not be an easy one. As the coastline fades behind you, the vastness of the ocean brings both awe and unease.

Once the party secures transportation, their voyage begins across the Sword Sea, a stretch of ocean notorious for its treacherous weather and mysterious phenomena. Known for its strong currents and unpredictable fey influences, the Sword Sea is both a gateway to adventure and a graveyard for the unprepared. The waves shimmer unnaturally under moonlight, and sailors often speak in hushed tones about ghost ships and Feywild portals that appear without warning. For the party, this crossing will test their skills, unity, and resolve as they face the perils of the open sea. Depending on the speed of the ship the party has chosen the journey will take a variable amount of time. Please refer to the table below for some examples.

| **Ship Type**        | **Base Speed** | **Travel Time to Caer Callidyr** |
| -------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Small Schooner       | Fast           | 6 Days                           |
| Medium Merchant Ship | Moderate       | 8 Days                           |
| Large Cargo Ship     | Slow           | 16 Days                          |

### Events at Sea

When sailing to the Moonshae Isles, once per day roll a d10 to determine an event that occurs:

| d10 | Event |
| --- | ----- |
| 1   | **Storm at Sea:** Players must work together to secure the ship using Strength (Athletics, DC 13), Dexterity (Acrobatics, DC 14), and Wisdom (Survival, DC 12) checks. Failure damages the ship. |
| 2   | **Fey Intrusion:** A mysterious fog rolls in, and illusions confuse the crew. Wisdom (Insight, DC 14) or Intelligence (Arcana, DC 15) checks reveal reality. Failure risks heading off course adding an extra day to the journey. |
| 3   | **Sea Monster Encounter:** A kraken or large sea serpent attacks, requiring teamwork to fend it off with the ship’s ballistae. |
| 4   | **Ghostly Apparition:** A spectral ship appears, shadowing the schooner. It vanishes if ignored but attacks if challenged. A Wisdom (Insight, DC 14) check reveals its motives. |
| 5   | **Mysterious Island:** The ship drifts toward a previously uncharted island. Wisdom (Survival, DC 12) prevents the ship from running aground. Intelligence (Investigation, DC 13) reveals abandoned supplies on the island. |
| 6   | **Fey Blessing:** The party encounters a peaceful fey who offers cryptic guidance or temporary boons, such as faster winds or smooth waters (See Table: *Boons At Sea*). |
| 7   | **Calm Seas:** The day passes uneventfully with smooth waters and a steady breeze. No skill checks or additional encounters occur. |
| 8   | **Unsettling Quiet:** The sea is eerily calm, and no other ships are seen. Players may make a Wisdom (Perception, DC 13) check to notice strange whispers on the wind, hinting at an unseen fey presence. |
| 9   | **Passing Ship:** A merchant or fishing vessel crosses paths with the party. Players may attempt to interact with the crew using Charisma (Persuasion, DC 12) or Charisma (Deception, DC 14) to gain information or supplies. |
| 10  | **Bountiful Catch:** The ship passes through waters teeming with fish. Players may use Wisdom (Survival, DC 12) to catch extra food, reducing supply costs for the journey. |

| d4 | Boon |
| -- | ---- |
| 1  | Favorable Winds: The ship's speed increases, reducing the journey by 1 day. |
| 2  | Calm Waters: The ship gains advantage on navigation checks for the next 24 hours. |
| 3  | Magical Gift: A small magical item (e.g., a driftglobe or a potion of water breathing) appears on the deck. |
| 4  | Protective Blessing: The ship gains temporary immunity to storm damage for the next 48 hours. |


This chapter ends as the players spot the verdant shores of the Moonshae Isles, where the next chapter of their adventure begins.
