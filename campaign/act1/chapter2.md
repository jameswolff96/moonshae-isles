## Chapter 2: Passage to the Isles

## Section 1: Securing Passage

> **Read Aloud:**
> The salty breeze carries the cries of gulls and the rhythmic creak of wooden hulls. The docks are alive with activity—sailors hoisting crates, merchants shouting deals, and the constant hum of the sea. Among the many vessels moored here, each tells its own story. A sturdy green-painted ship named *The Emerald Gale* bobs steadily, its proud banner fluttering in the wind. Nearby, a heavily-laden merchant ship looms large, its crew working with practiced efficiency under the sharp gaze of its first mate, his gaze flicks toward you, and for a moment, he seems to weigh your worth before returning to his duties. At the far edge of the docks, various schooners fill out the docks including a smaller schooner resting in shadow, its aged wood and faint glowing runes hinting at secrets best left unspoken. The choices before you seem as varied as the sea itself.

#### Option 1: Charter a Ship

- **The Emerald Gale**: Captained by the experienced and dependable **Daenor "Seafoam" Lothar**, this sturdy vessel is well-suited to the open seas and the fey-touched storms that surround the Isles.
- **Challenges:** Negotiating a fair price (Charisma [Persuasion] DC 13), dealing with rival captains trying to outbid them (Charisma [Deception] DC 15), or handling dockside disputes (Strength [Athletics] DC 12).

#### Option 2: Passage on a Merchant Ship

- **The Salted Gull**: A merchant vessel under the command of **First Mate Alric Sands**, who demands the party guard the cargo during the journey.
- **Challenges:** Convincing the merchant guild to allow them aboard (Charisma [Persuasion] DC 14), dealing with potential saboteurs (Wisdom [Insight] DC 13) or theft onboard (Dexterity [Sleight of Hand] DC 15 to catch a thief).

#### Option 3: Acquire Their Own Ship

- **A Caer Schooner**: Fresh from the shipyard in Caer Calidyrr this schooner has yet to be named. (See *Appendix D*)
  - **Price:** The owner of this ship is looking to make a sell at full price (30,000 GP), but might be willing to settle for a little less if the players are persuasive enough. 
  - **Crew Requirements:** This ship will require a total of 8 crew including the players to operate at full efficiency, the crew that come in on the ship are willing to stay with the players, but require their wages for the voyage up front (10 GP/day/crew member)
  - **Challenges:** The ships owner is a shrewd man, but a Charisma [Persuasion] DC 18 might convince him to bring down the price 10%

- **The Drawn and Quartered**: A former pirate schooner recently repossesed by the Neverwinter Guard.(See *Appendix D*)
  - **Price:** This ship will be offered at auction, the highest opposing bid should be no more than 18,000 GP.
  - **Crew Requirements:** This ship will require a total of 6 crew including the players to operate at full efficiency. If needed dock hands are readily available, but require their wages for the voyage up front (10 GP/day/crew member)
  - **Challenges:** Convincing the guards to let the party join the auction will be no easy task, they must convince them of their good hearts. A Charisma [Persuasion] DC 16 or a Charisma [Deceiption] DC 20. If the guards witness the players performing a good act give them advantage on these checks, disadvantage if they are seen preforming an evil act

- **The Wailing Mariner**: A small schooner with an eerie, aged appearance. Its dark wood hull is covered in faint, glowing runes, and its sails appear intact but unnaturally tattered. (See *Appendix D*)
  - **Price:** Initially asking for 12,000 GP the shipwright, Reeda Wainwright, is so desperate to rid herself of the vessel she offers it to the player for free if pressed. She claims it has brought her nothing but bad luck and insists that as its new owners the players "accept all responsibility" for anything that happens to them.
  - **Crew Requirements:** This ship will require a total of 5 crew including the players to operate at full efficiency. The only dock hand willing to join the players on this ship is **Thalen Voss** doing so with only the promise of payment (*See Appendix C*)
  - **Challenges:** The challenges with this ship will only reveal themselves once the party is at sea.

### Wrapping up Section 1
Once the players have obtained a method of travel to the Moonshae Isle's move on to Section 2.

## Section 2: Setting Sail

> **Read Aloud:**
> The Sword Sea stretches before you, its waves shimmering faintly as if touched by magic. Sailors whisper tales of sudden storms and ghostly lights that dance on the horizon. The air is thick with salt and mystery, and the creak of the ship’s hull reminds you that this journey will not be an easy one. As the coastline fades behind you, the vastness of the ocean brings both awe and unease.

Once the party secures transportation, their voyage begins across the Sword Sea, a stretch of ocean notorious for its treacherous weather and mysterious phenomena. Known for its strong currents and unpredictable fey influences, the Sword Sea is both a gateway to adventure and a graveyard for the unprepared. The waves shimmer unnaturally under moonlight, and sailors often speak in hushed tones about ghost ships and Feywild portals that appear without warning. For the party, this crossing will test their skills, unity, and resolve as they face the perils of the open sea. Depending on the speed of the ship the party has chosen the journey will take a variable amount of time. Please refer to the table below for some examples.

| **Ship Type**        | **Base Speed** | **Travel Time to Caer Callidyr** |
| -------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Small Schooner       | Fast           | 6 Days                           |
| Medium Merchant Ship | Moderate       | 8 Days                           |
| Large Cargo Ship     | Slow           | 16 Days                          |

### Events at Sea

When sailing to the Moonshae Isles, once per day roll a d10 to determine an event that occurs:

| d10 | Event |
| --- | ----- |
| 1   | **Storm at Sea:** Players must work together to secure the ship using Strength (Athletics, DC 13), Dexterity (Acrobatics, DC 14), and Wisdom (Survival, DC 12) checks. Failure damages the ship. |
| 2   | **Fey Intrusion:** A mysterious fog rolls in, and illusions confuse the crew. Wisdom (Insight, DC 14) or Intelligence (Arcana, DC 15) checks reveal reality. Failure risks heading off course adding an extra day to the journey. |
| 3   | **Sea Monster Encounter:** A kraken or large sea serpent attacks, requiring teamwork to fend it off with the ship’s ballistae. |
| 4   | **Ghostly Apparition:** A spectral ship appears, shadowing the schooner. It vanishes if ignored but attacks if challenged. A Wisdom (Insight, DC 14) check reveals its motives. |
| 5   | **Mysterious Island:** The ship drifts toward a previously uncharted island. Wisdom (Survival, DC 12) prevents the ship from running aground. Intelligence (Investigation, DC 13) reveals abandoned supplies on the island. |
| 6   | **Fey Blessing:** The party encounters a peaceful fey who offers cryptic guidance or temporary boons, such as faster winds or smooth waters (See Table: *Boons At Sea*). |
| 7   | **Calm Seas:** The day passes uneventfully with smooth waters and a steady breeze. No skill checks or additional encounters occur. |
| 8   | **Unsettling Quiet:** The sea is eerily calm, and no other ships are seen. Players may make a Wisdom (Perception, DC 13) check to notice strange whispers on the wind, hinting at an unseen fey presence. |
| 9   | **Passing Ship:** A merchant or fishing vessel crosses paths with the party. Players may attempt to interact with the crew using Charisma (Persuasion, DC 12) or Charisma (Deception, DC 14) to gain information or supplies. |
| 10  | **Bountiful Catch:** The ship passes through waters teeming with fish. Players may use Wisdom (Survival, DC 12) to catch extra food, reducing supply costs for the journey. |

| d4 | Boon |
| -- | ---- |
| 1  | Favorable Winds: The ship's speed increases, reducing the journey by 1 day. |
| 2  | Calm Waters: The ship gains advantage on navigation checks for the next 24 hours. |
| 3  | Magical Gift: A small magical item (e.g., a driftglobe or a potion of water breathing) appears on the deck. |
| 4  | Protective Blessing: The ship gains temporary immunity to storm damage for the next 48 hours. |
