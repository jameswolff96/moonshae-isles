## Chapter 1: A Missing Friend

### Opening Scene

> **Read Aloud:**
> The Seafarer's Rest buzzes with the energy of a busy evening. Lanterns sway from iron brackets, casting warm golden light over patrons hunched over steaming bowls of stew. The salty tang of the sea mingles with the rich aroma of spiced fish. As you gather around the table, the absence of one chair feels heavier with every passing moment. The lively chatter of the inn fades into the background as you exchange glances, wondering where Eryndor might be.

The adventure begins at **The Seafarer's Rest**, a cozy yet bustling inn in **Neverwinter**, nestled along the busy docks of the Sword Coast. The inn's warm light spills out onto the cobbled streets as the evening crowd gathers, and the aroma of spiced fish stew fills the air. The party, as previously agreed at the conclusion of their last adventure, has come together on this specific day to celebrate their recent successes and discuss future plans.

However, as the hours pass, the absence of one member becomes apparent: **Eryndor Valin**, the enigmatic wizard and longtime companion, has not arrived. Concerned whispers fill the table as the party wonders what could have delayed him. Just as the unease begins to settle, the innkeeper, a wiry half-elf named **Marin Hollows** (See *Appendix C*), approaches with a folded letter in hand, speaking curiously.

> **Read Aloud:** 
> "Excuse me, it's been about a week, but I believe this was left for you all. The gentleman said you'd understand."

The letter, sealed with a faintly glowing glyph in the shape of an angular black obelisk, is unmistakably from Eryndor. Inside, the message reads:

> *My friends,*\
> *I regret that I cannot join you tonight as planned, but I have stumbled upon something of great importance. The very artifact my family has sought for generations is within reach, but I must act quickly to claim it.*\
> *If you wish to follow, make your way to the Moonshae Isles. There, the answers await. Trust in the Earthmother, and you will find me.*\
> *Eryndor*

Beneath the message, an intricate sketch of an angular black obelisk is drawn, covered in runes that seem to shimmer faintly in the light. Alongside the sketch is a series of glyphs and symbols that appear to be part of a cipher.

### Key Elements for the DM

- **The Letter:** Players can inspect the letter and attempt to decipher the glyphs using Intelligence (Arcana, DC 12) or Intelligence (Investigation, DC 14) checks. Success reveals additional hints pointing to fey portals in the Moonshae Isles. Provide a physical handout with the sketch and glyphs to immerse the players.

- **The Innkeeper:** Marin can provide minor details about Eryndor's demeanor when he left the letter, noting his urgency and a slight air of excitement.

- **The Map:** If allowed to eavesdrop or if filled in by the players Marin can also provide the players with a large map of the moonshae isles, this map will serve as their guide throughout the entire campaign.

- **Initial Player Decisions:** Encourage roleplay as the party discusses their options and decides how to proceed.

### Wrapping up Chapter 1

Regardless of how the players procede they will likely end up in search of passage to the Moonshae Isles at this point whether it is by Marin or another NPC the players should be pointed to the docks.

### Chapter 1 NPCs

#### Marin Hollows
- **Role:** Innkeeper of The Seafarer’s Rest.
- **Personality:** Friendly and inquisitive, with a knack for remembering names and faces.
- **Hooks:** Marin can provide the party with information about local shipwrights and captains. If asked, he will hint at rumors surrounding a "haunted" schooner for sale at the docks. He will also direct the party to the city of Caer Callidyrr as that is likely where their friend ended up first providing an old  map he has from his time in the Navy.
