# Chapter 4: Into the Silver Glade
## Overview
The party’s investigations in Caer Callidyrr lead them to the Silver Glade, a mystical forest on the outskirts of the city where the Feywild and Material Plane intertwine. Here, the players will face natural obstacles, fey guardians, and ancient puzzles as they uncover more about Eryndor’s quest and the artifact he sought. The glade is a place of beauty and danger, where each step could bring revelation—or ruin.

## Section 1: Entering the Silver Glade
> **Read Aloud:**
> The edge of the Silver Glade rises before you like the border of a dream. Towering trees form an almost impenetrable canopy, their branches braided with glimmering vines that pulse faintly in the twilight. Strange, melodic whispers drift on the wind, and the air is thick with the scent of blooming flowers and damp earth. The forest floor is a riot of colors—mosses and fungi glowing softly in the shadows. A narrow trail winds into the heart of the glade, where the light seems to dim and shift with every step.

## Section 2: Navigating the Glade
The party must navigate the shifting and disorienting paths of the glade, which is imbued with fey magic. Each encounter should reflect the glade’s ethereal nature, emphasizing exploration and mystery.

### Skill Challenge: The Disorienting Paths
- **Setup:** The glade’s trails twist and shift, making navigation difficult. Fey illusions obscure landmarks, and subtle enchantments pull travelers off-course.

- **Skills:**
    - Wisdom (Survival, DC 13): To track their path and recognize subtle changes in the terrain.
    - Intelligence (Arcana, DC 14): To identify the magical nature of the illusions.
    - Charisma (Persuasion, DC 15): To convince a mischievous fey guide to help them find their way.
- **Outcome:** Success allows the party to proceed without incident. Failure causes them to lose time and triggers a random encounter (see Encounters below).

## Section 3: Encounters in the Silver Glade
| d6 | Encounter |
| -- | --------- |
| 1  | Fey Tricksters: A group of sprites or pixies plays pranks on the party. Their antics can escalate into combat if provoked. |
| 2  | Enchanted Grove: The party stumbles upon a grove where time flows strangely. Resting here accelerates healing but comes at a cost—such as aging or forgotten memories. |
| 3  | Cursed Roots: Thick, living roots block the path, attacking if disturbed. Treat them as animated objects with constricting attacks. |
| 4  | Guardian of the Glade: A treant or dryad confronts the party, questioning their purpose in the forest. Diplomacy is key to avoid conflict. |
| 5  | Phantom Vision: The party witnesses a ghostly replay of Eryndor’s journey, showing him performing a ritual or solving a puzzle. |
| 6  | Portal Surge: A Feywild portal briefly opens, releasing hostile creatures (e.g., blink dogs or quicklings) before closing. |

## Section 4: The Fey Obelisk
> **Read Aloud:**
> At the center of the glade stands a towering obelisk of black stone, its surface covered in glowing runes that shimmer like liquid gold. The air around it hums with power, and the ground beneath your feet feels warm, as if the forest itself is alive with anticipation. The runes shift and twist as you approach, forming strange patterns that seem almost familiar.

### The Puzzle: Deciphering the Obelisk
- **Setup:** The obelisk requires the party to solve a series of puzzles to unlock its secrets. These could include:
    - **Rune Matching:** Players must align the glowing runes on the obelisk with those found in Eryndor’s letter (Intelligence [Investigation], DC 14).
    - **Magical Sequence:** A magical lock opens only if the players activate the runes in the correct order, determined by clues found earlier (Intelligence [Arcana], DC 15).
    - **Fey Bargain:** A voice emanates from the obelisk, offering hints in exchange for a memory, a magical item, or another significant cost.
    - **Outcome:** Solving the puzzle reveals a map etched into the obelisk’s surface, pointing to an ancient temple deeper in the Isles—the next step in Eryndor’s quest.

## Section 5: Wrapping Up Chapter 4
As the chapter concludes, the party uncovers vital clues about Eryndor’s path and the artifact’s fey origins. They leave the Silver Glade armed with knowledge but also marked by its strange magic. Whether they’ve earned the trust of the glade’s guardians or left behind more questions than answers, their journey is now irrevocably tied to the mysteries of the Moonshae Isles.
