# Chapter 3: Arrival in Caer Callidyrr

## Overview

This chapter begins as the party arrives in **Caer Callidyrr**, the bustling capital of the Moonshae Isles. The city is a hub of trade, culture, and intrigue, sitting on the border between the natural world and the magical influence of the Feywild. The players will navigate political tensions, investigate clues about Eryndor’s whereabouts, and begin to uncover the deeper mysteries tied to the artifact he sought.

## Introduction

> **Read Aloud:**
> As your ship approaches the docks of Caer Callidyrr, the city sprawls before you, its white stone walls gleaming in the afternoon sun. The harbor buzzes with activity—fishermen unloading their catches, traders haggling over exotic goods, and dockworkers shouting orders to one another. Beyond the docks, the city rises in tiers, with narrow streets winding upward toward the castle that dominates the skyline. Its towers stand tall, banners emblazoned with the sigil of the Kendrick family—an anchor entwined with a crescent moon—fluttering in the sea breeze. This is a place where history and magic intertwine, and as you step ashore, you sense that the city holds both answers and dangers in equal measure.

## Key Elements

1. **Political Intrigue**:

   - Should the party ally with Lady Kendrick, they gain resources and protection but may be drawn into the city’s political struggles.
   - Alternately, they can avoid the castle entirely, focusing instead on fey-related mysteries.

2. **Trust in the Fey**:

   - Encountering Fey allies or enemies requires the players to make careful decisions. Bargains with the Fey often have unintended consequences.

3. **Resource Management**:

   - Players may need to negotiate for supplies, magical items, or transportation as they prepare to leave the city for the next phase of their journey.
