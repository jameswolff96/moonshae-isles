# Appendix D: Items and Vehicles

- **The Wailing Mariner:**

  - **Description:** A small schooner with an eerie, aged appearance. Its dark wood hull is covered in faint, glowing runes, and its sails appear intact but unnaturally tattered.
  - **Price:** Initially asking for half price the shipwright, Reeda Wainwright, is so desperate to rid herself of the vessel she offers it to the player for free. She claims it has brought her nothing but bad luck and insists that as its new owners the players "accept all responsibility" for anything that happens to them.
  - **History:** The ship is cursed, its previous owners having vanished or died under mysterious circumstances.

- **Cursed Ship Mechanics:**

  - **Mysterious Events:** At sea, the ship begins to creak and groan as if alive. Strange whispers echo below deck, and crew members (including the party) may experience nightmares.
  - **Skill Challenges:** The curse occasionally manifests as sabotaged rigging (Dexterity [Acrobatics] DC 13), sudden malfunctions (Intelligence [Investigation] DC 15), or eerie illusions (Wisdom [Perception] DC 14). Players must succeed on Wisdom (Insight), Intelligence (Investigation), or Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks to resolve these issues.
  - **Fey Connection:** The curse ties the ship to the Feywild, and the party may encounter fey creatures or be pulled into the Feywild unexpectedly during storms or certain magical events.

- **Lifting the Curse:** To free the ship from its curse, the party must uncover its history and perform a ritual at a sacred site within the Moonshae Isles.
