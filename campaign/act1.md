# Act 1: The Gathering Storm

## Overview
The journey begins with the party reuniting in Neverwinter, only to find their companion Eryndor missing and a cryptic letter in his place. This letter leads the adventurers on a perilous voyage across the Sword Sea to the fey-touched Moonshae Isles. Along the way, they must secure transportation, confront the dangers of the sea, and navigate the mysteries surrounding a cursed ship, The Wailing Mariner.

Upon arriving in Caer Callidyrr, the party delves into the city's political intrigues, uncovers clues about Eryndor’s whereabouts, and begins to understand the artifact he sought. Following his trail, they journey to the mystical Silver Glade and the ruins of a forgotten temple, where ancient puzzles, fey creatures, and hostile forces challenge their progress. The act culminates with the discovery of Eryndor’s fate and the artifact’s dangerous potential, setting the stage for deeper mysteries and greater threats in the acts ahead.

## Chapter 1: A Missing Friend

### Opening Scene

> **Read Aloud:**
> The Seafarer's Rest buzzes with the energy of a busy evening. Lanterns sway from iron brackets, casting warm golden light over patrons hunched over steaming bowls of stew. The salty tang of the sea mingles with the rich aroma of spiced fish. As you gather around the table, the absence of one chair feels heavier with every passing moment. The lively chatter of the inn fades into the background as you exchange glances, wondering where Eryndor might be.

The adventure begins at **The Seafarer's Rest**, a cozy yet bustling inn in **Neverwinter**, nestled along the busy docks, the aroma of spiced fish stew fills the air. The party, as previously agreed at the conclusion of their last adventure, has come together on this specific day to celebrate their recent successes and discuss future plans.

However, as the hours pass, the absence of one member becomes apparent: **Eryndor Valin**, the enigmatic wizard and longtime companion, has not arrived. The inn's warm light spills out onto the cobbled streets as the evening crowd gathers,  Concerned whispers fill the table as the party wonders what could have delayed him. Just as the unease begins to settle, the innkeeper, a wiry half-elf named **Marin Hollows**, approaches with a folded letter in hand.

"Excuse me," Marin says, his voice tinged with curiosity, "it's been about a week, but I believe this was left for you. The gentleman said you'd understand."

The letter, sealed with a faintly glowing glyph in the shape of an angular black obelisk, is unmistakably from Eryndor. Inside, the message reads:

> *My friends,*\
> *I regret that I cannot join you tonight as planned, but I have stumbled upon something of great importance. The very artifact my family has sought for generations is within reach, but I must act quickly to claim it.*\
> *If you wish to follow, make your way to the Moonshae Isles. There, the answers await. Trust in the Earthmother, and you will find me.*\
> *Eryndor*

Beneath the message, an intricate sketch of an angular black obelisk is drawn, covered in runes that seem to shimmer faintly in the light. Alongside the sketch is a series of glyphs and symbols that appear to be part of a cipher.



Marin Hollows



Role: Innkeeper of The Seafarer’s Rest.



Personality: Friendly and inquisitive, with a knack for remembering names and faces.



Hooks: Marin can provide the party with information about local shipwrights and captains. If asked, he will hint at rumors surrounding a "haunted" schooner for sale at the docks. He will also direct the party to the city of Caer Callidyrr as that is likely where their friend ended up first providing an old  map he has from his time in the Navy.

### Key Elements for the DM

- **The Letter:** Players can inspect the letter and attempt to decipher the glyphs using Intelligence (Arcana, DC 12) or Intelligence (Investigation, DC 14) checks. Success reveals additional hints pointing to fey portals in the Moonshae Isles. Provide a physical handout with the sketch and glyphs to immerse the players.

- **The Map:** Provide the players with the large map, it will be their guidee throughout the entire campaign

- **The Innkeeper:** Marin can provide minor details about Eryndor's demeanor when he left the letter, noting his urgency and a slight air of excitement.

- **Initial Player Decisions:** Encourage roleplay as the party discusses their options and decides how to proceed.

### Possible Outcomes

- If the players decode the glyphs, they will find additional hints pointing to the fey portals in the Moonshae Isles.
- If the players decide to leave immediately, they can charter a ship from Neverwinter's docks to begin their journey.

## Chapter 2: Passage to the Isles

### Securing Passage

> **Read Aloud:**
> The salty breeze carries the cries of gulls and the rhythmic creak of wooden hulls. The docks are alive with activity—sailors hoisting crates, merchants shouting deals, and the constant hum of the sea. Among the many vessels moored here, each tells its own story. A sturdy green-painted ship named *The Emerald Gale* bobs steadily, its proud banner fluttering in the wind. Nearby, a heavily-laden merchant ship looms large, its crew working with practiced efficiency under the sharp gaze of its first mate, his gaze flicks toward you, and for a moment, he seems to weigh your worth before returning to his duties. At the far edge of the docks, a smaller schooner rests in shadow, its aged wood and faint glowing runes hinting at secrets best left unspoken. The choices before you seem as varied as the sea itself.&#x20;

#### Option 1: Charter a Ship

- **The Emerald Gale**: Captained by the experienced and dependable **Daenor "Seafoam" Lothar**, this sturdy vessel is well-suited to the open seas and the fey-touched storms that surround the Isles.
- **Challenges:** Negotiating a fair price (Charisma [Persuasion] DC 13), dealing with rival captains trying to outbid them (Charisma [Deception] DC 15), or handling dockside disputes (Strength [Athletics] DC 12).

#### Option 2: Passage on a Merchant Ship

- **The Salted Gull**: A merchant vessel under the command of **First Mate Alric Sands**, who demands the party guard the cargo during the journey.
- **Challenges:** Convincing the merchant guild to allow them aboard (Charisma [Persuasion] DC 14), dealing with potential saboteurs (Wisdom [Insight] DC 13) or theft onboard (Dexterity [Sleight of Hand] DC 15 to catch a thief).

#### Option 3: Acquire Their Own Ship

> **Read Aloud:**
> Near the edge of the dockyard, past rows of bustling ships, lies a smaller schooner docked in shadow. Its hull is worn but seaworthy, and faint, glowing runes are etched along the wood. These runes match those found in Eryndor's note, sparking a sense of foreboding and intrigue. Nearby, a wiry human woman leans against a crate, her gaze darting nervously between the ship and the bustling crowd, as though she’s trying to avoid drawing attention.

- **The Wailing Mariner:**

  - **Description:** A small schooner with an eerie, aged appearance. Its dark wood hull is covered in faint, glowing runes, and its sails appear intact but unnaturally tattered.
  - **Price:** Initially asking for half price the shipwright, Reeda Wainwright, is so desperate to rid herself of the vessel she offers it to the player for free. She claims it has brought her nothing but bad luck and insists that as its new owners the players "accept all responsibility" for anything that happens to them.
  - **History:** The ship is cursed, its previous owners having vanished or died under mysterious circumstances.

- **Cursed Ship Mechanics:**

  - **Mysterious Events:** At sea, the ship begins to creak and groan as if alive. Strange whispers echo below deck, and crew members (including the party) may experience nightmares.
  - **Skill Challenges:** The curse occasionally manifests as sabotaged rigging (Dexterity [Acrobatics] DC 13), sudden malfunctions (Intelligence [Investigation] DC 15), or eerie illusions (Wisdom [Perception] DC 14). Players must succeed on Wisdom (Insight), Intelligence (Investigation), or Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks to resolve these issues.
  - **Fey Connection:** The curse ties the ship to the Feywild, and the party may encounter fey creatures or be pulled into the Feywild unexpectedly during storms or certain magical events.

- **Lifting the Curse:** To free the ship from its curse, the party must uncover its history and perform a ritual at a sacred site within the Moonshae Isles.

### Dockside NPCs

#### **Daenor "Seafoam" Lothar**

- **Role:** Captain of The Emerald Gale.
- **Personality:** Gruff but reliable, with a love for storytelling about the sea.
- **Hooks:** Daenor is willing to negotiate his price but insists on the party proving themselves trustworthy, possibly through a small task like delivering a parcel to another captain.

#### **Alric Sands**

- **Role:** First Mate of The Salted Gull.
- **Personality:** Stern and pragmatic, focused on protecting his cargo.
- **Hooks:** Alric requires the party to take an oath of service during the voyage. He will be suspicious if the players hesitate or inquire too much about the cargo.

#### **Reeda Wainwright**

- **Role:** Local shipwright and seller of The Wailing Mariner.
- **Personality:** Nervous and evasive, constantly looking over her shoulder.
- **Hooks:** Reeda will emphasize the ship’s low price but avoid answering questions about its history. Players with a Wisdom (Insight, DC 12) check can detect her unease, and with a Charisma (Intimidation, DC 14) or Charisma (Persuasion, DC 15) check, she may reveal details about the ship’s curse if pressed.

#### **Thalen "Lucky" Voss**

- **Role:** A charismatic dockworker who offers to join the party as crew.
- **Personality:** Charming and optimistic, though his "luck" often gets others into trouble.
- **Hooks:** Thalen’s luck is actually tied to a minor fey blessing, which occasionally backfires. His presence could lead to both fortuitous and disastrous events during the voyage.

### Setting Sail

> **Read Aloud:**
> The Sword Sea stretches before you, its waves shimmering faintly as if touched by magic. Sailors whisper tales of sudden storms and ghostly lights that dance on the horizon. The air is thick with salt and mystery, and the creak of the ship’s hull reminds you that this journey will not be an easy one. As the coastline fades behind you, the vastness of the ocean brings both awe and unease.

Once the party secures transportation, their voyage begins across the Sword Sea, a stretch of ocean notorious for its treacherous weather and mysterious phenomena. Known for its strong currents and unpredictable fey influences, the Sword Sea is both a gateway to adventure and a graveyard for the unprepared. The waves shimmer unnaturally under moonlight, and sailors often speak in hushed tones about ghost ships and Feywild portals that appear without warning. For the party, this crossing will test their skills, unity, and resolve as they face the perils of the open sea. Depending on the speed of the ship the party has chosen the journey will take a variable amount of time. Please refer to the table below for some examples.

| **Ship Type**        | **Base Speed** | **Travel Time to Caer Callidyr** |
| -------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Small Schooner       | Fast           | 6 Days                           |
| Medium Merchant Ship | Moderate       | 8 Days                           |
| Large Cargo Ship     | Slow           | 16 Days                          |

| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Storm at Sea:** Players must work together to secure the ship using Strength (Athletics, DC 13), Dexterity (Acrobatics, DC 14), and Wisdom (Survival, DC 12) checks. Failure damages the ship.                                  |
| 2   | **Fey Intrusion:** A mysterious fog rolls in, and illusions confuse the crew. Wisdom (Insight, DC 14) or Intelligence (Arcana, DC 15) checks reveal reality. Failure risks heading off course adding an extra day to the journey. |
| 3   | **Sea Monster Encounter:** A kraken or large sea serpent attacks, requiring teamwork to fend it off with the ship’s ballistae.                                                                                                    |
| 4   | **Ghostly Apparition:** A spectral ship appears, shadowing the schooner. It vanishes if ignored but attacks if challenged. A Wisdom (Insight, DC 14) check reveals its motives.                                                   |
| 5   | **Mysterious Island:** The ship drifts toward a previously uncharted island. Wisdom (Survival, DC 12) prevents the ship from running aground. Intelligence (Investigation, DC 13) reveals abandoned supplies on the island.       |
| 6   | **Fey Blessing:** The party encounters a peaceful fey who offers cryptic guidance or temporary boons, such as faster winds or smooth waters (See Table Boons At Sea).                                                             |
| 7   | **Calm Seas:** The day passes uneventfully with smooth waters and a steady breeze. No skill checks or additional encounters occur.                                                                                                |
| 8   | **Unsettling Quiet:** The sea is eerily calm, and no other ships are seen. Players may make a Wisdom (Perception, DC 13) check to notice strange whispers on the wind, hinting at an unseen fey presence.                         |
| 9   | **Passing Ship:** A merchant or fishing vessel crosses paths with the party. Players may attempt to interact with the crew using Charisma (Persuasion, DC 12) or Charisma (Deception, DC 14) to gain information or supplies.     |
| 10  | **Bountiful Catch:** The ship passes through waters teeming with fish. Players may use Wisdom (Survival, DC 12) to catch extra food, reducing supply costs for the journey.                                                       |

This chapter ends as the players spot the verdant shores of the Moonshae Isles, where the next chapter of their adventure begins.



## Chapter 3: Arrival in Caer Callidyrr

#### Overview

This chapter begins as the party arrives in **Caer Callidyrr**, the bustling capital of the Moonshae Isles. The city is a hub of trade, culture, and intrigue, sitting on the border between the natural world and the magical influence of the Feywild. The players will navigate political tensions, investigate clues about Eryndor’s whereabouts, and begin to uncover the deeper mysteries tied to the artifact he sought.

> As your ship approaches the docks of Caer Callidyrr, the city sprawls before you, its white stone walls gleaming in the afternoon sun. The harbor buzzes with activity—fishermen unloading their catches, traders haggling over exotic goods, and dockworkers shouting orders to one another. Beyond the docks, the city rises in tiers, with narrow streets winding upward toward the castle that dominates the skyline. Its towers stand tall, banners emblazoned with the sigil of the Kendrick family fluttering in the sea breeze. This is a place where history and magic intertwine, and as you step ashore, you sense that the city holds both answers and dangers in equal measure.
